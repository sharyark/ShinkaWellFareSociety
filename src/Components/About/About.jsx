//             Shinka Welfare Society is a non-profit charitable organization dedicated to uplifting our community. Registered since 2019, we conduct emergency relief operations during natural or man-made disasters.

//             In 2019, our village experienced a tragic incident when Fareed Prince was involved in a severe accident. Due to the lack of an ambulance, there was a significant delay in getting him to the hospital. This incident deeply affected Fareed's brother, Saeed Khan, and his friends. Motivated to prevent such tragedies in the future, they decided to take action. With the consent and support of the local people, Shinka Welfare Society was established. Through community meetings, awareness campaigns, and generous contributions from villagers, including those living abroad, we raised funds and launched our first ambulance service, providing a crucial new service to the locals.
